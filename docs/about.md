My name is Yoonsoo P. Bach. I was born on the Vernal Equinox day of 1993, in Seoul, South Korea. My mother tongue language is, thus, Korean. I can also speak Japanese (able to have simple conversations).



I was interested in astrnomy since when I saw the HST photos of the horsehead nebula and Pleiades in the science textbook in 2006. Then I joined a group of students at an academy (for the [KAO](http://www.kasolym.org/) (Korean Astronomy Olympiad) at the academy named "Highest"). I cannot remember the name of the teacher who taught us for the first 1-2 months, but I do appreciate Jisun Shin, who taught us for the next few months until the olympiad (we still do keep in touch even now). Jisun was the one who helped me the most during my first years of studying astronomy. That led me to earn a bronze prize in the 7th KAO and the 5th KESO in 2007.
